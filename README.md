# classifier_brain_tumor
🗒️ Answer
This repository hosts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for brain tumor detection. Leveraging the dataset available on Kaggle [1], our classifier aims to accurately identify the presence of tumors in brain MRI images. Contributions to medical image analysis and early tumor detection are central to this project.
