# classifier_brain_tumor
🗒️ Answer
This repository hosts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for brain tumor detection. Leveraging the dataset available on Kaggle [1], our classifier aims to accurately identify the presence of tumors in brain MRI images. Contributions to medical image analysis and early tumor detection are central to this project. Your feedback and contributions are welcome.
